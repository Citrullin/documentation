# What is a seed?

**A seed is a secret password that's used to derive address/private key pairs and to sign bundles whose transactions withdraw IOTA tokens.**

A seed can be used to derive an almost unlimited amount of addresses: Enough that you don't need to worry about ever running out!

[Addresses](root://iota-basics/0.1/concepts/addresses-and-signatures.md) are the accounts from which [transactions](../introduction/what-is-a-transaction.md) are sent and received.

Private keys are used to sign bundles, which proves ownership of an address and allows IOTA tokens to be withdrawn from it.
