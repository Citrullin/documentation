# What is a node?

**A node is a device that has read and write access to the Tangle in an IOTA network. All nodes store a copy of the Tangle and a record of addresses that hold IOTA tokens. Clients can send their bundles to any node in an IOTA network so it can validate the transactions, attach them to the Tangle, and forward them to other nodes.**

IOTA is a permissionless DLT. So, anyone can run a node, including individuals and businesses.

Node owners often don't open them to the public because a high volume of API calls can be costly. As a result, we suggest that you run your own node for direct access to an IOTA network.

If you can't run your own node, you can use the public ones in Trinity or use websites such as [IOTA Dance](https://iota.dance) to find a list them.

To use any IOTA network, you can interact with a node through the [client libraries](root://client-libraries/0.1/introduction/overview.md). Many IOTA applications, such as [Trinity](root://wallets/0.1/trinity/introduction/overview.md), use one of these client libraries behind the scenes.
