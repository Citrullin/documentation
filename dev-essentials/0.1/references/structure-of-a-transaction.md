# Structure of a transaction

**This table displays a list of fields that form a transaction.** 

A transaction consists of 2673 tryte-encoded characters. When decoded, the transaction object contains the following fields.

| **Field**                         | **Type**   | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | **Length (trytes)** |
| :----------------------------- | :------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------ |
| `signatureMessageFragment`      | string | A signature or a message, both of which may be _fragmented_ over multiple transactions in the bundle. This field contains a signature if the transaction withdraws IOTA tokens. Otherwise, this field can contain a tryte-encoded message or all 9's where no message is defined. | 2187   |
| `address`                       | string | Contains either the sender or recipient's address. This field contains a recipient's address if the transaction is an output. Otherwise, this field contains an address from which IOTA tokens are being withdrawn (transaction with a negative `value` field).   | 81     |
| `value`                    | integer    | Amount of IOTA tokens to deposit to or withdraw from the address                                                                                                                                                                                            | 27     |
| `obsoleteTag`                   | string | User-defined tag (soon to be removed)                                                                                                                                                                                               | 27     |
| `timestamp`                     | integer    | Unix epoch: Seconds since Jan 1, 1970 (not-enforced and can be arbitrary)                                                                                                                                                                                    | 9      |

| `bundle`                        | string | Hash of the bundle. In a bundle, the values of each transaction's `address`, `value`, `obsoleteTag`, `currentIndex`, `lastIndex` and `timestamp` fields are absorbed and squeezed by a cryptographic sponge function to produce this bundle hash.                                 | 81     |
