# Update the IRI

**The IRI is in a beta development stage, so it's likely to change, meaning that you'll need to update it.**

When a new version of the [IRI is released on GitHub](https://github.com/iotaledger/iri/releases), we recommend that you update your local IRI to the new version.

1. Stop the IRI

2. Delete the `mainnetdb` directory, the `mainnet.log` file, and your current IRI .jar file

    :::warning:
    Do not delete your `spent-address-db` directory.

4. [Download the latest IRI](../how-to-guides/run-an-iri-node-on-linux.md#download-the-pre-built-iri-java-file)

5. [Run the IRI](../how-to-guides/run-an-iri-node-on-linux.md#run-the-iri)
