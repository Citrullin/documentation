# Create an IOTA network

**If you want to test your application in your own IOTA network, you can run Compass. All IRI nodes in the network must be set up to recognize your Compass transactions as trusted milestones.**

For this basic setup, you'll install an IRI node and Compass on the same server or virtual machine. You can also install an optional signing server for increased security.

A signing server reduces the attack surface of Compass by moving sensitive operations to an external service. Compass interacts with the signing server through gRPC.

To create your own IOTA network, you must complete the following tasks in order:

1. [Install the dependencies](#install-the-dependencies)
2. [Calculate the Merkle tree](#calculate-the-merkle-tree)
3. [Run an IRI node](#run-an-iri-node)
4. [Run Compass](#run-compass)
5. [Test the network](#test-your-network)

## Prerequisites

A Linux server with the following minimum requirements. If you are on a Windows or Mac operating system, you can [create a Linux server in a virtual machine](root://general/0.1/how-to-guides/set-up-virtual-machine.md).

* A new installation of an Ubuntu 18.04 Server / Virtual Machine
* At least 8GB RAM
* Preferably 4+ CPU cores, the more cores the faster the Merkle tree will be generated.
* At least a 10GB SSD

## Install the dependencies

Compass uses [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) to build and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to run, so we need to make sure both are installed.

1. Install the dependencies for Bazel
	```bash
	sudo apt-get install pkg-config zip g++ zlib1g-dev unzip python
	```

2. Download the latest Bazel installer
	```bash
	wget https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/download/0.18.0/bazel-0.18.0-installer-linux-x86_64.sh
	```

3. Check that you can execute the script before you run it
	```bash
	chmod +x bazel-0.18.0-installer-linux-x86_64.sh
	```

4. Install Bazel under your active user, using the `--user` flag
	```bash
	./bazel-0.18.0-installer-linux-x86_64.sh --user
	```
	You may need to restart your computer after you install Bazel.

5. Install Docker
	```bash
	sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
	curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
	sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu bionic stable"
	sudo apt update
	sudo apt install docker-ce
	```
	
6. Install the `jq` tool for formatting JSON data
	```bash
	sudo add-apt-repository universe
	sudo apt install jq
	```

## Calculate the Merkle tree

For this guide, we use a [Merkle tree](../concepts/about-compass.md#merkle-tree-generation) with a depth of 16, which allows us to run compass for 45 days in a row at 1-minute-milestone intervals.

The Compass repository includes a tool to generate a Merkle tree and save it in a data folder for Compass to use later on. 

1. Clone the Compass GitHub repository
	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/iotaledger/compass.git
	cd compass
	```

2. Build the `layers_calculator` tool that will generate the Merkle tree
	```bash
	bazel run //docker:layers_calculator
	```
	This process can take some time. You should see something like the following in the output:
	```
	INFO: SHA256 (https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/archive/fe7f043504d66e1b3f674c0514ce794c8a56884e.zip) = 19c51698d4837d1978a10ed7a01f4e45a0b15bcbd3db44de2a2a1c3bdd1cf234
	Analyzing: target //docker:layers_calculator (8 packages loaded)
	```

3. Create a seed for Compass
	```bash
	cat /dev/urandom |LC_ALL=C tr -dc 'A-Z9' | fold -w 81 | head -n 1 
	```

4. Create a backup of the seed

5. Change into the directory that contains the scripts for setting up and running Compass
	```bash
	cd docs/private_tangle
	```

6. Copy the example configuration file
	```bash
	cp config.example.json config.json
	```

7. Open the `config.json` file and replace the value of the `seed` field with the seed you generated in step 3
	```bash
	nano config.json
	```

8. Change the value of the `depth` field to `16`

	The finished `config.json` file should look like this:
	```json
	{
		"seed": "MYSEEDHEREPLEASEREPLACEMEIMMEDIATELYWITHSOMETHINGSECURE99999999999999999999999999",
		"powMode": "CURLP81",
		"sigMode": "CURLP27",
		"security": 1,
		"depth": 16,
		"milestoneStart": 0,
		"mwm": 9,
		"tick": 60000,
		"host": "http://localhost:14265"
	}
	```

9. Make sure Docker is aware of the `layers_calculator` image
	```bash
	sudo ../../bazel-bin/docker/layers_calculator
	```
	If the command was not found, do step 2 again.

	You should see something like the following in the output:

	```
	668afdbd4462: Loading layer  18.39MB/18.39MB
	6189abe095d5: Loading layer  1.966MB/1.966MB
	55b77d5f2576: Loading layer    100MB/100MB
	b439be5d084f: Loading layer  16.15MB/16.15MB
	Loaded image ID: sha256:164cc0fbec2cd2b1821d0442d7f63e52f0f34250c2b9af12f1dcddde12d7df56
	Tagging 164cc0fbec2cd2b1821d0442d7f63e52f0f34250c2b9af12f1dcddde12d7df56 as iota/compass/docker:layers_calculator
	```

10. Create the Merkle tree by executing the script in the `docs/private_tangle` directory
	```bash
	sudo ./01_calculate_layers.sh
	```

This process will take a while (with a 4 core virtual machine it takes around 15 minutes). After the process finishes, the root of the Merkle tree is displayed in the output:

```shell
[main] INFO org.iota.compass.LayersCalculator - Calculating 65536 addresses.
...
[main] INFO org.iota.compass.LayersCalculator - Successfully wrote Merkle Tree with root: JMRTYHMGNZGNOLPSSBVLWRPMGIAMOXPLURNDIBKXIFTCJCLOYKH9FMVNKPBVFVMGSUFEYVUUIEARFQXAK
```

The Merkle tree of addresses is stored in the data directory, so Compass can use it when it starts running.

## Run an IRI node

Compass must send milestones to an IRI Node. Compass sends milestones to an IRI node through an HTTP RPC API on the default `14265` port or on whichever port is passed during initialization.

To make the IRI node recognize Compass transactions as trusted milestones, we created a script that uses the default IRI Docker container with some additional parameters.

The IRI node must use a snapshot.txt file to set the initial state of the ledger.

The `snapshot.example.txt` file puts the total IOTA supply of 2.7Pi in the first address that's generated by the following client seed:
`SEED99999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999`. The first address (index 0) of this seed is  `FJHSSHBZTAKQNDTIKJYCZBOZDGSZANCZSWCNWUOCZXFADNOQSYAHEJPXRLOVPNOQFQXXGEGVDGICLMOXX` (excluding the checksum). 

1. Create a `snapshot.txt` file
	```bash
	touch snapshot.txt
	nano snapshot.txt
	```

2. Add the following line to the `snapshot.txt` file:
	```shell
	FJHSSHBZTAKQNDTIKJYCZBOZDGSZANCZSWCNWUOCZXFADNOQSYAHEJPXRLOVPNOQFQXXGEGVDGICLMOXX;2779530283277761
	```

	**Note:** Do not exceed the maximum supply of 2.7Pi.

3. Run the IRI
	```bash
	sudo ./02_run_iri.sh
	```

	**Note:** If you see a `malformed snapshot state file` error, check the snapshot.txt file and make sure that you didn't include a line break at the end of the line. If you see a `NumberFormatException` error or an `IllegalArgumentException` error, check that no space characters are either side of the semicolon.

4. Press `CTRL+C` in the command prompt. IRI will continue to run in the background.

## Run Compass

After you've generated the Merkle tree and you're running an IRI node, you can run Compass.

1. Go back to your compass directory and run bazel
	```bash
	cd ~/compass/
	bazel run //docker:coordinator
	```

2. Run the Docker container
	```bash
	sudo ../../bazel-bin/docker/coordinator
	```
	
3. Change into the directory that contains the scripts for setting up and running Compass
	```bash
	cd docs/private_tangle
	```

4. Run Compass
	```bash
	sudo ./03_run_coordinator.sh -bootstrap -broadcast
	```

Compass is sending milestones :tada:

**Note:** Compass will stop sending milestones if the Merkle tree runs out of branches. To avoid this problem, use an appropriate value for the `depth` field of the Merkle tree configuration file.

## Test your network

You can connect to your IRI node on port 14265, using Trinity or a client library.

1. Connect to your IRI node

2. Enter the `SEED99999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999` seed

Your balance should be 2.7Pi (you may have to attach the first address, depending on what client library or wallet you use).

Feel free to send test transactions and see them confirmed by Compass milestones.
