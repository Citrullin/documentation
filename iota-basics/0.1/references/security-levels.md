# Security levels of addresses

**This table displays the possible security levels of an address. The higher the security level, the larger the signature, and the more transactions that are needed to contain it.**

The security level is the same number of key fragments and key digests that a private key has.


| Security Level | Private key/signature length                   |
| :-------------- | :-------------------------- |
| 1              | 2,187 (not recommended) |
| 2              | 4,374 (used by Trinity)         |
| 3              | 6,561 (most secure)           |
