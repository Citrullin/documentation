# Structure of a transaction

**This table displays a list of fields that form a transaction.** 

A transaction consists of 2673 tryte-encoded characters. When decoded, the transaction object contains the following fields.

| Field                         | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Length (trytes) |
| :----------------------------- | :------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------ |
| `signatureMessageFragment`      | string | A signature or a message, both of which may be _fragmented_ over multiple transactions in the bundle. This field contains a signature if the transaction debits IOTA tokens. Otherwise, this field can contain a tryte-encoded message or all 9's where no message is defined. | 2187   |
| `address`                       | string | Contains either the sender or recipient's address. This field contains a recipient's address if the transaction is an output. Otherwise, this field contains an address from which IOTA tokens are being debited (transaction with a negative `value` field).   | 81     |
| `value`                    | integer    | Amount of IOTA tokens to credit to or debit from the address                                                                                                                                                                                            | 27     |
