# Perform a snapshot transition

**During a global snapshot, nodes remove old transaction data from their ledgers to free memory. After a global snapshot, nodes have only the addresses with a balance of at least 1i. If you don't see your correct balance after a global snapshot, you must perform a snapshot transition to allow Trinity to request the latest balance of your addresses.**

:::info:
Trinity is stateful, which means that it stores a local copy of your transaction history on your device. As a result, you can still see your transaction history after a global snapshot.
