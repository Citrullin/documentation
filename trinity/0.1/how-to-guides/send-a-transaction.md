# Send a transaction

**Trinity has a user interface that allows you to send multiple transactions at the click of a button.**

If you have multiple accounts in your Trinity wallet, make sure that you select the correct account from the dropdown menu.

:::info:
To send to an address in Trinity, it must include the 9-tryte checksum. If you generated a new address in Trinity, that address will already include the checksum.
:::

1. Click **Send**

2. Enter a recipient's address

  :::danger:Important
  On Android devices, any application can read the content of keyboard presses and modify it. Be careful when pasting an address into Trinity and make sure that the address you have pasted is the same one that you copied.
  :::

3. Enter either a message, or an amount of IOTA tokens, or both

    :::info:
    The amount to send can be entered in units of IOTA or in the [currency of your choice](../how-to-guides/change-the-general-settings.md). Pay close attention to the IOTA units (i, Mi, Gi,) that you're sending.
