# Connect to a custom IRI node

**Instead of using the built-in node balancing service, you can connect to a custom IRI node in Trinity.**

You may want to connect to your own IRI node or an IRI node on the Devnet network.

To connect to a different IRI node, go to **Settings** > **Node**, and enter the URL or IP address of an IRI node.
