# Run an nRF52 sensor server and a client

**In this guide you set up a 6LoWPAN IoT sensor server that accepts UDP requests for data.**

## Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you need the following:

- A DHT11 or DHT22 sensor
- An [nRF52832 microcontroller](set-up-nrf52-microcontroller.md) to use as a sensor server
- Either a single-board computer (SBC) such as a Raspberry Pi or a PC to use as a client
- [Configure a 6LoWPAN network](set-up-a-bluetooth-star-network.md)
- [Install the Go toolchain on either your SBC or your PC](https://golang.org/doc/install)

## Architecture

The environment sensor runs a server application, which uses the request-response message pattern by opening a UDP port and waiting for incoming requests.

The response is sent back to the client on the same port the client sends a message. For example, if the client (the SBC or the PC) sends a UDP packet on port 90 (outgoing-port at the SBC) to port 51037 (incoming-port on the sensor), 
the sensor will send the response to port 90 (SBC or PC).

Technically, both devices run a server to receive UDP packets. 
On an abstract level, this design is still a request-response message pattern, 
because the sensor only responds with UDP packets when it receives a correct request. This design is necessary only to keep the traffic as small as possible.
UDP is a connection-less protocol, which is more efficient and more resilient than TCP.

## Run the sensor server and client

1. Connect the DHT sensor to your microcontroller
    
2. Start the server on your microcontroller
    
    :::info:
    You need to execute the following command in the serial console of your microcontroller.

    The shell terminal of your microcontroller is opened in the terminal where you executed the `make flash term` command.
    :::
    
    ```bash
    server start
    ```
    
3. Clone the client onto your Linux-based SBC or PC

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/iota-community/BLE-environment-sensor-client.git $GOPATH/src/github.com/citrullin/udp_client
    ```
    
4. Run the client application

    ```bash
    cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/citrullin/udp_client && go run client.go
    ```
