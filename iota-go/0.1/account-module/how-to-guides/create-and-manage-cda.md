# Make payments to/from your account

**To make payments, both the sender and the receiver need to have a conditional deposit address (CDA). The sender needs an expired CDA that contains IOTA tokens, and the receiver needs an active CDA to send tokens to.**

## Conditions of a CDA

When you create a CDA, you specify the `timeoutAt` field to define whether it's active or expired. You can deposit IOTA tokens into an active address. But, you can't withdraw tokens from an active address. You can withdraw tokens from an expired address. But, you can't deposit tokens into an expired address.

You can also specify one of the following recommended fields:

* **multiUse (recommended):** A boolean that specifies if the address may receive more than one deposit.
* **expectedAmount (recommended):** The amount of IOTA tokens that the address is expected to receive. When the address contains this amount, it's considered expired. We recommend specifying this condition.

:::info:
You can't specify the `expected_amount` and `multi_use` fields in the same CDA. Please refer to the [FAQ](../references/cda-advice.md) for more advice about CDA conditions.
:::

|  **Combination of fields** | **Withdrawal conditions**
| :----------| :----------|
|`timeoutAt` |The CDA can used in withdrawals as long as it contains IOTA tokens|
|`timeoutAt` and `multiUse` (recommended) |The CDA can be used in withdrawals as soon as it expires, regardless of how many deposits were made to it. See the [CDA FAQ](../references/cda-advice.md) on when to use addresses with the `multiUse` field set. |
|`timeoutAt` and `expectedAmount` (recommended) | The CDA can be used in withdrawals as soon as it contain the expected amount. See the [CDA FAQ](../references/cda-advice.md) on when to use addresses with the `multi_use` field set.|

:::warning:Warning
If a CDA was created with only the `timeoutAt` field, it can be used in withdrawals as soon as it has a non-zero balance even if it hasn't expired. 

To avoid withdrawing from a spent address, we recommend creating CDAs with either the `multiUse` field or with the `expectedAmount` field whenever possible.
:::

:::info:
CDAs can be used only in an account and not in the generic client library methods. As a result, both you and the sender must have an account to be able to use CDAs.

1. Import the required packages

    ```go
    "time"

	"github.com/iotaledger/iota.go/account/deposit"
	"github.com/iotaledger/iota.go/account/oracle"
	oracle_time "github.com/iotaledger/iota.go/account/oracle/time"
    ```

2. Create a new CDA that expires tomorrow

    ```go
    // Get the current time
    now, err := timesource.Time()
    handleErr(err)

    now = now.Add(time.Duration(24) * time.Hour)

    // Specify the conditions
    conditions := &deposit.Conditions{TimeoutAt: &now, MultiUse: true}

    cda, err := account.AllocateDepositAddress(conditions)
    handleErr(err)
    ```

3. After making sure that the CDA is still active, send a deposit to it
    
    ```go
    bundle, err := account.Send(cda.AsTransfer())
    handleErr(err)

    fmt.Printf("Made deposit into %s in the bundle with the following tail transaction hash %s\n", cda.Address, bundle[0].Hash)
    ```

    You should see something like the following in the output:

    ```
    Made deposit into DL9CSYICJVKQRUTWBFUCZJQZ9WNBSRJOA9MGOISQZGGHOCZTXVSKDIZN9HBORNGDWRBBAFTKXGEJIAHKDTMAUX9ILA in the bundle with the following tail transaction hash WZEATTRJYENRALJTWPVGDQZHETIDJXPUROUM9BBPS9RJEELDMU9YNZFBSDGPQHZHMXBVCKITSMDEEQ999
    ```

    If you want to test this sample code with free test tokens, [request some from the Devnet faucet](root://getting-started/0.1/tutorials/receive-test-tokens.md).
    :::

    :::info:
    The last 9 characters of a CDA are the checksum, which is a hash of the address and all of its conditions. This checksum is not compatible with Trinity or the Devnet faucet because they don't yet support CDAs.
    
    Remove the checksum before pasting your address into the input field of either of these applications.

## Automate the decision-making process

A CDA may expire during the time it takes for a bundle to be created, sent, and confirmed. So, you need to make a decision about whether to deposit into a CDA, depending on its conditions. To automate this decision-making process, you can create an [oracle](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.go/tree/master/account/oracle) that returns a decision (true or false) about whether to deposit into it.

Oracles take an oracle source as an argument and return `true` if the oracle source decides that you may deposit into the CDA.

1. Use the [`TimeDecider` oracle source](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.go/tree/master/account/oracle/time) to check if the CDA's expiration time is at least 30 minutes away. These 30 minutes give the bundle time to be sent and confirmed.

    ```go
    threshold := time.Duration(30)*time.Minute
    // timeDecider is an OracleSource
    timeDecider := oracle_time.NewTimeDecider(timesource, threshold)
    // Create a new SendOracle with the given OracleSources
    sendOracle := oracle.New(timeDecider)
    ```

    :::info:
    To avoid conflicts with the `time` package, you must add a prefix to the `"github.com/iotaledger/iota.go/account/oracle"` import. In this example, we use the `oracle_time` prefix.
    :::

2. To call the oracle, pass the CDA to the `OkToSend()` method of the `sendOracle` object

    ```go
    // Ask the SendOracle whether we should make a deposit
    ok, rejectionInfo, err := sendOracle.OkToSend(cda)
    handleErr(err)
    if !ok {
        fmt.Println("Won't send transaction: ", rejectionInfo)
        return
    }
    ```

## Transfer your entire account balance to one CDA

You may want to keep the majority of your balance on as few CDAs as possible. This way, making payments is faster and requires fewer transactions. To do so, you can transfer you available balance to a new CDA.

:::info:
Available balance is the total balance of all expired CDAs. This balance is safe to withdraw.

Your account's total balance includes CDAs that are still active as well as expired. This balance is unsafe to withdraw.
:::

1. Create a CDA that has your account's total available balance as its expected amount

    ```go
    // Get the current time
    now, err := timesource.Time()
    handleErr(err)

    now = now.Add(time.Duration(24) * time.Hour)

    // Specify the conditions
    conditions := &deposit.Conditions{TimeoutAt: &now, MultiUse: false, ExpectedAmount: account.AvailableBalance() }

    cda, err := account.AllocateDepositAddress(conditions)
    handleErr(err)
    ```

2. Transfer your total usable balance to the CDA

    ```go
    bundle, err := account.Send(cda.AsTransfer())
    handleErr(err)

    fmt.Printf("Made deposit into %s in the bundle with the following tail transaction hash %s\n", cda.Address, bundle[0].Hash)
    ```

## Send someone your CDA

If you want a depositer to transfer IOTA tokens to your account, you need to send them your CDA.

Because CDAs are descriptive objects, you can serialize them into any format before sending them. The `generateCDA()` method returns a CDA object with the following fields. You can serialize a CDA into any format before distributing it to senders.

```js
{
   address, // The last 9 trytes are the checksum
   timeout_at,
   multi_use,
   expected_amount
}
```

For example, you can serialize these fields to create a magnet link.

### Serialize a CDA into a magnet link

The built-in method for serializing a CDA is to create a magnet link.

1. To serialize the CDA into a magnet link, use the `AsMagnetLink()` method of the CDA object

    ```go
    fmt.Println(cda.AsMagnetLink())
    // iota://MBREWACWIPRFJRDYYHAAMEâ€¦AMOIDZCYKW/?timeout_at=1548337187&multi_use=1&expected_amount=0
    ```

2. To send a transaction to a CDA that's been serialized into a magnet link, deserialize the magnet link into a CDA

    ```go
    cda, err := deposit.ParseMagnetLink(cda.AsMagnetLink())
    handleErr(err)
    ```
