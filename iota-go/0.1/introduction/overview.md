# Go client library

**The Go client library allows you to use any of the supported packages to write applications that act as a client or a server to interact with the Tangle.**

## [Core](../core/introduction/overview.md)
The Go core client library includes low-level methods for interacting with the Tangle. You can use this library to use the core IOTA protocol. For example, you can connect to nodes, create bundles, and promote and reattach pending transactions.

## [Account module](../account-module/introduction/overview.md)
An account is an object that makes it easier to send and receive transactions. Accounts store data such as addresses and pending bundle hashes in a local database. This data allows you to interact with an IOTA network without worrying about withdrawing from spent addresses or promoting and reattaching pending transactions. All of this functionality is handled for you behind the scenes.
