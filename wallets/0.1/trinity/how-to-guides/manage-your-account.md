# Manage your account

**Trinity allows you to have multiple accounts, each of which has a unique seed.**

For each of your accounts, you can do the following:

* Access your seed (not available if you use a hardware wallet)
* View your addresses and their available balance
* Change the name of an account

Make sure that you select the correct account to manage before completing any of these tasks.

To access Account management on a mobile device, go to **Settings** > **Account management**.

To access Account management on a desktop, go to the burger menu >  **Account** > **Account management**.

## Access your seed

Each account that you create uses a different seed.

To access the seed, go to Account management, and click **View seed**.

## View your addresses

Each seed can be used to generate an almost unlimited number of addresses.

To view the addresses that you've generated, go to Account management, and click **View addresses**.

:::info:
A red line through the center of an address means that the address has been spent. Trinity stops you from withdrawing IOTA tokens from spent addresses, so you must never deposit IOTA tokens into them.

## Change your account's name

To make it easier to manage multiple accounts, you can give each of them a unique name.

To change the name of an account, go to Account management, and click **Account name**.

## Change your login password

Trinity stores your seeds for you (unless you use a [hardware wallet](../concepts/hardware-wallet.md)) and allows you to log in with a password.

To change the login password on a desktop, go to **Settings** > **Change password**.

To change the login password on a mobile device, go to **Settings** > **Security settings** > **Change password**.
