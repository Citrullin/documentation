# Run a nRF52 sensor and client
**In this guide we create a professional 6LoWPAN IoT sensor node setup. 
The sensor gets an individual IPv6 address. Therefore, we can send UDP/IP packets to this sensor.**

## Prerequisites

- nRF52832 or nRF52840 
**Note:** The nRF52840 is newer and supports more radio standards. It is our recommendation.
- [Installed nRF toolchain](root://iot/0.1/how-to-guides/set-up-nrf-toolchain.md)
