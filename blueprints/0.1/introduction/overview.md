# Application blueprints

**Application blueprints are documents that explain how the IOTA technology can be used to solve real-world problems and to support well-defined business needs.**

Blueprints are designed to do the following:

* Describe a problem and a solution that uses IOTA
* Present an architecture that shows how to solve the problem by integrating IOTA into your existing systems
* Explain how you can test, edit, and deploy the blueprint

## Who should use blueprints?

Anyone who either wants to build real-world applications with IOTA or wants to evaluate IOTA for a specific business case.

You can use blueprints as a reference to build and deploy a similar solution into other systems and to test different business models.
